To get error messages on the build you have to go through settings on your github pages <https://help.github.com/en/articles/viewing-jekyll-build-error-messages>

How pathetic is that? Settings is for settings, not build error messages.

Then there is the use of jekyll-optional-front-matter - a default plugin you cannot change. Why?
